Examples of such\nsoftware include LogMeIn, GoToMyPC, VNC (Virtual Network Computing), and\nWindows Remote Desktop (RDP).  While these tools can save significant\ntime and money by eliminating travel and enabling collaboration, they\nalso provide a back door into the Data Migrators network that can be\nused for theft of, unauthorized access to, or destruction of assets.
