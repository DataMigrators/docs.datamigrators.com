Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish a systematic process for identifying, categorizing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities within the Data Migrators software ecosystem, infrastructure, and third-party dependencies. This ensures that security risks are managed proactively and transparently.\n\n## 2. Scope\nThis policy applies to all technical assets owned or managed by Data Migrators, including:\n\n* **Production Infrastructure:** Cloud environments (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).\n* **Application Code:** Proprietary source code and build artifacts.\n* **Third-Party Dependencies:** Open-source libraries, APIs, and sub-processors.\n* **Container Images:** Base images and application containers.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Vulnerability Discovery Lifecycle\nWe utilize a multi-layered detection strategy to ensure no single point of failure in our security visibility:\n\n| Discovery Method | Frequency | Target Area |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Static Analysis (SAST)** | Every Commit | Code-level flaws (e.g., SQLi, Hardcoded secrets). |\n| **Software Composition (SCA)** | Continuous | Vulnerabilities in third-party/open-source libraries. |\n| **Infrastructure Scanning** | Weekly | Cloud misconfigurations and OS-level vulnerabilities. |\n| **Dynamic Analysis (DAST)** | Monthly | Running application behavior and endpoints. |\n| **Penetration Testing** | Annual | Manual deep-dive testing by certified third-party firms. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Risk Categorization and Prioritization\nVulnerabilities are initially ranked using the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**. Final prioritization is determined by the Security Team based on the **exploitability** and **business impact** of the affected asset.\n\n### 4.1 Remediation Service Level Objectives (SLOs)\nOnce a vulnerability is confirmed (not a false positive), Data Migrators aims to remediate according to the following timelines:\n\n| Severity | CVSS Score | Remediation Target |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Within [e.g., 48 hours] |\n| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Within [e.g., 14 days] |\n| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9 | Within [e.g., 60 days] |\n| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Best effort / Next scheduled release |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Remediation and Treatment Options\nData Migrators recognizes that not all CVEs are immediately \"patchable.\" One of the following four actions must be taken for every identified vulnerability:\n\n1.  **Remediation:** Full patching or code change to remove the vulnerability.\n2.  **Mitigation:** Implementing compensating controls (e.g., WAF rules, IP whitelisting) that prevent exploitation even if a patch is unavailable.\n3.  **Risk Acceptance:** Formally accepting the risk if the vulnerability is deemed \"low impact,\" a false positive, or if the cost of fixing exceeds the potential risk.\n4.  **Decommissioning:** Removing the vulnerable component, library, or feature from the environment.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Exception Management\nIf a **Critical** or **High** vulnerability cannot be remediated within the defined SLO (e.g., due to lack of an upstream patch or risk of system instability), a **Security Exception** must be documented. \n* Exceptions must include a justification and a timeline for a permanent fix.\n* All exceptions must be reviewed and signed off by the [CTO/Head of Security].\n\n---\n\n## 7. Reporting and Audit\n* **Vulnerability Registry:** All findings are tracked in [e.g., GitHub Security/Jira/Snyk].\n* **Evidence of Compliance:** Data Migrators maintains logs of scan results and remediation actions for audit purposes (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).\n* **Customer Disclosure:** Summary reports regarding our vulnerability posture are available to customers under NDA upon request.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Policy Review\nThis policy is reviewed annually or following significant changes to the software architecture to ensure alignment with industry best practices and emerging threat landscapes.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"bdfb5f4fd6f263481746060a214f2f52","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":366},"frontmatter":{"title":"Vulnerability Management Policy","description":"Our vulnerability management policy","keywords":"policy,vulnerability,security,markdown"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Vulnerability Management Policy\ndescription: Our vulnerability management policy\nkeywords: 'policy,vulnerability,security,markdown'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes Data Migrators' policy on the management of vulnerabilities.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n    <AnchorLink>Purpose</AnchorLink>\n    <AnchorLink>Scope</AnchorLink>\n    <AnchorLink>Vulnerability Discovery Lifecycle</AnchorLink>\n    <AnchorLink>Risk Categorization and Prioritization</AnchorLink>\n    <AnchorLink>Remediation and Treatment Options</AnchorLink>\n    <AnchorLink>Exception Management</AnchorLink>\n    <AnchorLink>Reporting and Audit</AnchorLink>\n    <AnchorLink>Policy Review</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n# Vulnerability Management Policy\n\n## 1.
