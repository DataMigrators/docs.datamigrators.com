It is important to realize that having a\ncontingency plan in the event of a disaster gives Data Migrators a\ncompetitive advantage. This policy requires management to financially\nsupport and diligently attend to disaster contingency planning efforts.\nDisasters are not limited to adverse weather conditions. Any event that\ncould likely cause an extended delay of service should be considered.\nThe Disaster Recovery Plan is often part of the Business Continuity\nPlan.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis policy defines the requirement for a baseline disaster recovery\nplan to be developed and implemented by Data Migrators that will\ndescribe the process to recover IT Systems, Applications and Data from\nany type of disaster that causes a major outage.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis policy is directed to the IT Management Staff who is accountable to\nensure the plan is developed, tested and kept up-to-date. This policy is\nsolely to state the requirement to have a disaster recovery plan, it\ndoes not provide requirement around what goes into the plan or\nsub-plans.\n\n## Policy\n\n4.1 Contingency Plans\n\nThe following contingency plans must be created:\n\n-   Computer Emergency Response Plan: Who is to be contacted, when, and\n    how? What immediate actions must be taken in the event of certain\n    occurrences?\n\n-   Succession Plan: Describe the flow of responsibility when normal\n    staff is unavailable to perform their duties.\n\n-   Data Study: Detail the data stored on the systems, its criticality,\n    and its confidentiality.\n\n-   Criticality of Service List: List all the services provided and\n    their order of importance.\n\n-   It also explains the order of recovery in both short-term and\n    long-term timeframes.\n\n-   Data Backup and Restoration Plan: Detail which data is backed up,\n    the media to which it is saved, where that media is stored, and how\n    often the backup is done. It should also describe how that data\n    could be recovered.\n\n-   Equipment Replacement Plan: Describe what equipment is required to\n    begin to provide services, list the order in which it is necessary,\n    and note where to purchase the equipment.\n\n-   Mass Media Management: Who is in charge of giving information to the\n    mass media?\n\n-   Also provide some guidelines on what data is appropriate to be\n    provided.\n\nAfter creating the plans, it is important to practice them to the\nextent possible. Management should set aside time to test\nimplementation of the disaster recovery plan. Table top exercises\nshould be conducted annually. During these tests, issues that may\ncause the plan to fail can be discovered and corrected in an\nenvironment that has few consequences.\n\nThe plan, at a minimum, should be reviewed an updated on an annual\nbasis.\n\n## Policy Compliance\n\n### Compliance Measurement\nThe Infosec team will verify compliance to this policy through various\nmethods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-thrus, video\nmonitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and\nfeedback to the policy owner.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nAny exception to the policy must be approved by the Infosec Team in\nadvance.\n\n## Non-Compliance\n\nAn employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\n## Related Documents\n\nNone.\n\n## Definitions and Terms\n\nThe following definition and terms can be found in the [SANS Glossary](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/):\n\n-   Disaster\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"87fd38eea2403838e4813dedb3e259cb","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":331},"frontmatter":{"title":"Disaster Recovery Plan Policy","description":"Usage instructions for the Markdown component","keywords":"ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Disaster Recovery Plan Policy\ndescription: Usage instructions for the Markdown component\nkeywords: 'ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes Data Migrators' Disaster Recovery Plan policy.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Purpose</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Scope</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy Compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Exceptions</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Non-compliance</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Related Documents</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Definitions and Terms</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nSince disasters happen so rarely, management often ignores the disaster\nrecovery planning process.
