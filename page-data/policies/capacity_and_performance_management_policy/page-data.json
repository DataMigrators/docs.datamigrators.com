Purpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure that Data Migrators' systems are proactively monitored and managed to provide consistent performance, high availability, and scalability. This policy ensures that infrastructure capacity aligns with business growth and technical evolution.\n\n## 2. Policy Statement\n**Our organization requires that system resources are monitored to ensure adequate capacity for new, upgraded, or enhanced systems.**\n\nTo fulfill this requirement, Data Migrators shall:\n* Maintain a continuous baseline of resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage, and network).\n* Forecast future capacity requirements based on the product roadmap and sales projections.\n* Proactively identify and mitigate potential bottlenecks before they impact service delivery or customer experience.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Capacity Monitoring Procedures\n\n### 3.1 Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting\nAll production environments must be integrated with automated monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Datadog). \n* **Thresholds:** Automated alerts are configured to trigger when resource utilization exceeds **75%** of allocated capacity.\n* **Visibility:** Real-time dashboards must be maintained to provide the technical team with immediate visibility into system health.\n\n### 3.2 Cloud Elasticity and Auto-Scaling\nAs a cloud-native ISV, we utilize dynamic scaling to ensure \"adequate capacity\" is available on-demand:\n* **Auto-Scaling:** Critical application tiers must use Auto-Scaling Groups (ASGs) to handle traffic spikes.\n* **Quota Management:** AWS Service Quotas (limits) must be reviewed quarterly to ensure that account-level restrictions do not impede the ability to scale.\n\n### 3.3 New and Upgraded Systems\nBefore the deployment of any new software system or significant feature enhancement:\n* **Impact Assessment:** The engineering team must evaluate the expected resource consumption of the new code.\n* **Load Testing:** For major releases, load testing must be performed in a staging environment to validate that the production architecture can handle the anticipated increase in demand.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Resource Optimization\nTo balance resilience with cost-efficiency, the following practices are mandated:\n* **Right-Sizing:** Monthly reviews of infrastructure utilization to downsize underutilized resources.\n* **Decommissioning:** Procedures must be in place to identify and remove \"orphan\" resources (e.g., unattached storage volumes) that no longer contribute to system capacity.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Roles and Responsibilities\n* **Infrastructure/DevOps Team:** Responsible for implementing monitoring tools, managing auto-scaling logic, and responding to capacity alerts.\n* **Product Management:** Responsible for communicating forecasted increases in user load or data processing requirements.\n* **CTO/Engineering Lead:** Responsible for the strategic oversight of infrastructure spend and capacity planning.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Policy Compliance\nFailure to comply with this policy may result in service degradation or outages. Compliance is verified through annual internal audits and periodic reviews of monitoring logs and scaling performance.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"e9e3565a5131f9005dbe64a9e9bc63b5","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":322},"frontmatter":{"description":"Policies / Capacity And Performance Management Policy","title":"Policies / Capacity And Performance Management Policy"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"# Capacity and Performance Management Policy\n\n## 1.
