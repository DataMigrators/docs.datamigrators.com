The security features necessary to minimize risks to communication\n    equipment must be configured in the equipment before it is placed\n    into service. There are two possible roles for the staff that\n    manages the communication equipment: monitoring and administrator.\n    The monitoring role has read only privileges. The administrator role\n    is able to change configuration parameters. All issued commands by\n    users will be recorded, as well as any other security events that\n    may pose a threat to the equipment.\n1.  Local users are not allowed on communication equipment. Everyone\n    must authenticate through the central repository of users using a\n    protocol that reduces the risk of identity theft.\n\n1. All information transmitted from the device must be encrypted by a\n    strong encryption algorithm to minimize the risks of eavesdropping\n    on the communications and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n1. The events recorded by the communication equipment must be kept in\n    storage media that is subject to a regular backup process. The\n    process of maintaining these backups must ensure that the\n    information is not amended.\n1. The password of the communication equipment\\'s administrator user\n    must not be known by anyone on the staff that manages the equipment.\n    If, for any reason, it is necessary to make use of the highest\n    administrative privileges within the device, then the staff must\n    file a request to the internal security division for the password\n    attaching the justification for its use and completing the required\n    forms.
