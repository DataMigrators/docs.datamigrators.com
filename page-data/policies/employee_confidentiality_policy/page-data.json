Employees will unavoidably receive and handle personal and private information about clients, partners and our company. We want to make sure that this information is well-protected.\n\nWe must protect this information for two reasons. It may:\n-\tBe legally binding (e.g. sensitive customer data.)\n-\tConstitute the backbone of our business, giving us a competitive advantage (e.g. business processes.)\n\n## Scope\n\nThis policy affects all employees, including board members, investors, contractors and volunteers, who may have access to confidential information.\n\n## Policy elements\n\nConfidential and proprietary information is secret, valuable, expensive and/or easily replicated. Common examples of confidential information are:\n-\tUnpublished financial information\n-\tData of Customers/Partners/Vendors\n-\tPatents, formulas or new technologies\n-\tCustomer lists (existing and prospective)\n-\tData entrusted to our company by external parties\n-\tPricing/marketing and other undisclosed strategies\n-\tDocuments and processes explicitly marked as confidential\n-\tUnpublished goals, forecasts and initiatives marked as confidential\n\nEmployees may have various levels of authorized access to confidential information.\n\nWhat employees should do:\n-\tLock or secure confidential information at all times\n-\tShred confidential documents when they’re no longer needed\n-\tMake sure they only view confidential information on secure devices\n-\tOnly disclose information to other employees when it's necessary and authorized\n-\tKeep confidential documents inside our company's premises unless it's absolutely necessary to move them\n\nWhat employees shouldn't do:\n-\tUse confidential information for any personal benefit or profit\n-\tDisclose confidential information to anyone outside of our company\n-\tReplicate confidential documents and files and store them on insecure devices\n\nWhen employees stop working for our company, they're obliged to return any confidential files and delete them from their personal devices.\n\n### Confidentiality Measures\n\nWe'll take measures to ensure that confidential information is well protected. We'll:\n-\tStore and lock paper documents\n-\tEncrypt electronic information and safeguard databases\n-\tAsk employees to sign non-compete and/or non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)\n-\tAsk for authorization by senior management to allow employees to access certain confidential information\n\n## Exceptions\n\nConfidential information may occasionally have to be disclosed for legitimate reasons. Examples are:\n-\tIf a regulatory body requests it as part of an investigation or audit\n-\tIf our company examines a venture or partnership that requires disclosing some information (within legal boundaries)\nIn such cases, employees involved should document their disclosure procedure and collect all needed authorizations. We're bound to avoid disclosing more information than needed.\n\n## Disciplinary Consequences\n\nEmployees who don't respect our confidentiality policy will face disciplinary and, possibly, legal action.\n\nWe'll investigate every breach of this policy. We'll terminate any employee who willfully or regularly breaches our confidentiality guidelines for personal profit. We may also have to punish any unintentional breach of this policy depending on its frequency and seriousness. We'll terminate employees who repeatedly disregard this policy, even when they do so unintentionally.\n\nThis policy is binding even after separation of employment.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"85f32b3fe6b0c759ee47a8328327c417","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":332},"frontmatter":{"title":"Employee Confidentiality Policy","description":"Data Migrators' data protection policy","keywords":"ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Employee Confidentiality Policy\ndescription: Data Migrators' data protection policy\nkeywords: 'ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown'\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page describes Data Migrators' employee confidentiality policy.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Purpose</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Scope</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Policy Elements</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Exceptions</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Disciplinary Consequences</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Purpose\n\nWe designed our company confidentiality policy to explain how we expect our employees to treat confidential information.
