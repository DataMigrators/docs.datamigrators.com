Additionally, this\npolicy provides direction to ensure that Federal regulations are\nfollowed, and legal authority is granted for the dissemination and use\nof encryption technologies outside of the United States.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all Data Migrators employees and affiliates.\n\n## Policy\n\n**Algorithm Requirements**\n\n1.  Ciphers in use must meet or exceed the set defined as\n    \"AES-compatible\" or \"partially AES-compatible\" according\n    to the [IETF/IRTF Cipher\n    Catalog](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-cipher-catalog-01#section-3.1),\n    or the set defined for use in the United States [National\n    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication\n    FIPS\n    140-2](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/1401val2010.htm),\n    or any superseding documents according to the date of\n    implementation. The use of the Advanced Encryption Standard\n    (AES) is strongly recommended for symmetric encryption.\n\n2.

Key Agreement and Authentication\n\n    1.  Key exchanges must use one of the following cryptographic protocols: Diffie-Hellman, IKE, or Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).\n\n    2.  End points must be authenticated prior to the exchange or derivation of session keys.\n\n    3.  Public keys used to establish trust must be authenticated prior to use. Examples of authentication include transmission via cryptographically signed message or manual verification of the public key hash.\n\n    4.  All servers used for authentication (for example, RADIUS or TACACS) must have installed a valid certificate signed by a known trusted provider.\n\n    5.  All servers and applications using SSL or TLS must have the certificates signed by a known, trusted provider. \n\n2.  Key Generation\n\n    1.  Cryptographic keys must be generated and stored in a secure manner that prevents loss, theft, or compromise. \n\n    2.  Key generation must be seeded from an industry standard random number generator (RNG).
