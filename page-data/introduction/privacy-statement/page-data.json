To the extent that our software and websites can provide their functionality without doing so, we always prefer to avoid collecting any data from you. In the cases where we do collect data, we give you the ability to opt out whenever possible.\n\nSo, here's some detail about what our solutions and websites do, and why.\n\n# Cookies\nWe use cookies, which are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save user's preferences for future visits. We also use these to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services such as Google Analytics that track this information on our behalf.\n\nYou can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since browser is a little different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, the website will behave normally but might not “remember” your choices when selecting options.\n\n## Usage Analytics\n\nSome of our websites may collect information about the way you use them by default. This data is always anonymized before it is sent to us, and cannot be used to personally identify you. We look only for broad patterns in the aggregated usage data, such as whether or not a particular page is frequently used. This helps us make informed decisions about our future market messaging and customer engagement. To be clear, we cannot track an individual user's behavior. We also cannot receive information from your device's displays, cameras, or microphones.\n\n## Email List\n\nIn some of our websites you will be given a one-time opportunity to sign up for our email newsletter. If you decline, no data will be sent. If you accept, the email address you provide will be added to our email list.\n\nOur email list is low volume (usually no more than a few messages a year), and is generally limited to announcements of important new versions of our solutions, or significant new product releases. We do not sell or otherwise provide any of our email list to third parties, with the exception of the company that provides the mailing list services.\n\n## Activation\n\nFor some Data Migrators solutions you may be required to enter a serial number to unlock the solution, and may need to repeat this from time to time on already activated products, or as part of a licence renewal. No information is sent to Data Migrators during this process.\n\n## Logging\n\nWhen you interact with our servers using a web browser, or indirectly by network requests sent on your behalf by our solutions, some metadata about the request may be logged by us. This metadata may include your IP address, the name of the resource requested, and the name and version number of the software making the request.\n\nWe generally don't look at these logs unless a server appears to be being maliciously used or attacked in some way. We may look at the information in aggregate to see statistics such as how many times our solutions have been downloaded, or from what sources network traffic is arriving.\n\nData Migrators do not send out any private information. This includes:\n\n- Your keyboard or screen input\n- Network traffic\n- Hostnames\n- Usernames\n- Passwords\n- SSH / Encryption keys\n- Contents of files you are working with\n- Your IP address\n\n## Third Party Disclosure\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information except where necessary to execute a transaction for third party software on your behalf.\n\n## COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)\n\nWhen it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.\n\n## Fair Information Practices\n\nThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will notify you via email within 7 business days should a data breach occur.\n\nWe also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\n\n## CAN SPAM Act\n\nThe CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.\n\nWe collect your email address in order to send information, respond to inquiries and/or other requests or questions. To be in accordance with CAN SPAM, we agree to the following:\n\n- Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.\n- Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.\n- Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.\n- Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.\n- Honour opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.\n- Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.\n\nIf at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.\n\n## Website Data Collection\n\nData Migrators used Google Analytics to collect metrics to track the usage of our websites. We do this to assess the level of interest in our offerings and the popularity of product features. We do not collect any personal information and cannot identify you in any way using this information. The data transmitted is totally anonymous.\n\n## Questions and Feedback\n\nPlease contact us if you have any questions about our data collection or privacy policies. We'll be more than happy to discuss them with you.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"4d4043402f05b44811e6703fee06fa9f","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":314},"frontmatter":{"title":"Privacy Statement","description":"Data Migrators' Privacy Statement"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Privacy Statement\ndescription: Data Migrators' Privacy Statement\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\nThis page provides Data Migrators' Privacy Statement.\n</PageDescription>\n\n# Overview\nWe strongly believe you have the right to privacy when using our websites and software.\n\nOur privacy policy is simple: your data is none of our business.
