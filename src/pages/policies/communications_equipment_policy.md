## Overview

See Purpose.

## Purpose

This document describes requirements for communication equipment
security configurations of Data Migrators.

## Scope

This policy applies to all communication equipment that is part of the
data network of Data Migrators.

## Policy

1.  The security features necessary to minimize risks to communication
    equipment must be configured in the equipment before it is placed
    into service. There are two possible roles for the staff that
    manages the communication equipment: monitoring and administrator.
    The monitoring role has read only privileges. The administrator role
    is able to change configuration parameters. All issued commands by
    users will be recorded, as well as any other security events that
    may pose a threat to the equipment.
1.  Local users are not allowed on communication equipment. Everyone
    must authenticate through the central repository of users using a
    protocol that reduces the risk of identity theft.

1. All information transmitted from the device must be encrypted by a
    strong encryption algorithm to minimize the risks of eavesdropping
    on the communications and man-in-the-middle attacks.
1. The events recorded by the communication equipment must be kept in
    storage media that is subject to a regular backup process. The
    process of maintaining these backups must ensure that the
    information is not amended.
1. The password of the communication equipment\'s administrator user
    must not be known by anyone on the staff that manages the equipment.
    If, for any reason, it is necessary to make use of the highest
    administrative privileges within the device, then the staff must
    file a request to the internal security division for the password
    attaching the justification for its use and completing the required
    forms. The password must then be reset by the highest administrator
    to maintain security.
