# Vulnerability Management Policy

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish a systematic process for identifying, categorizing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities within the Data Migrators software ecosystem, infrastructure, and third-party dependencies. This ensures that security risks are managed proactively and transparently.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all technical assets owned or managed by Data Migrators, including:

* **Production Infrastructure:** Cloud environments (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
* **Application Code:** Proprietary source code and build artifacts.
* **Third-Party Dependencies:** Open-source libraries, APIs, and sub-processors.
* **Container Images:** Base images and application containers.

## 3. Vulnerability Discovery Lifecycle

We utilize a multi-layered detection strategy to ensure no single point of failure in our security visibility:

| Discovery Method | Frequency | Target Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Static Analysis (SAST)** | Every Commit | Code-level flaws (e.g., SQLi, Hardcoded secrets). |
| **Software Composition (SCA)** | Continuous | Vulnerabilities in third-party/open-source libraries. |
| **Infrastructure Scanning** | Weekly | Cloud misconfigurations and OS-level vulnerabilities. |
| **Dynamic Analysis (DAST)** | Monthly | Running application behavior and endpoints. |
| **Penetration Testing** | Annual | Manual deep-dive testing by certified third-party firms. |

## 4. Risk Categorization and Prioritization

Vulnerabilities are initially ranked using the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**. Final prioritization is determined by the Security Team based on the **exploitability** and **business impact** of the affected asset.

### 4.1 Remediation Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

Once a vulnerability is confirmed (not a false positive), Data Migrators aims to remediate according to the following timelines:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Remediation Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Within [e.g., 48 hours] |
| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9 | Within [e.g., 14 days] |
| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9 | Within [e.g., 60 days] |
| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9 | Best effort / Next scheduled release |


## 5. Remediation and Treatment Options

Data Migrators recognizes that not all CVEs are immediately "patchable." One of the following four actions must be taken for every identified vulnerability:

1.  **Remediation:** Full patching or code change to remove the vulnerability.
2.  **Mitigation:** Implementing compensating controls (e.g., WAF rules, IP whitelisting) that prevent exploitation even if a patch is unavailable.
3.  **Risk Acceptance:** Formally accepting the risk if the vulnerability is deemed "low impact," a false positive, or if the cost of fixing exceeds the potential risk.
4.  **Decommissioning:** Removing the vulnerable component, library, or feature from the environment.

## 6. Exception Management

If a **Critical** or **High** vulnerability cannot be remediated within the defined SLO (e.g., due to lack of an upstream patch or risk of system instability), a **Security Exception** must be documented. 

* Exceptions must include a justification and a timeline for a permanent fix.
* All exceptions must be reviewed and signed off by the [CTO/Head of Security].

## 7. Reporting and Audit

* **Vulnerability Registry:** All findings are tracked in [e.g., GitHub Security/Jira/Snyk].
* **Evidence of Compliance:** Data Migrators maintains logs of scan results and remediation actions for audit purposes (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).
* **Customer Disclosure:** Summary reports regarding our vulnerability posture are available to customers under NDA upon request.

## 8. Policy Review

This policy is reviewed annually or following significant changes to the software architecture to ensure alignment with industry best practices and emerging threat landscapes.
